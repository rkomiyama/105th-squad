    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
    <p>
      CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online 
      services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to 
      require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates 
      websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a 
      conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
      those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

    <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 
      years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The 
      Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, 
      which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's 
      privacy and safety online.
      We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
    </p>

    <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
    <p>
      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United 
      States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of 
      data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles
      and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that 
      protect personal information.
      In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive 
      action, should a data breach occur we will notify users via in-site notification within 7 
      business days.

    <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
    <p>
      The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements 
      for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to 
      them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
